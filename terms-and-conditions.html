        <p>
            Absolute Commerce extensions contain notification and licencing code to allow us to send messages regarding
            new releases, updates to modules and other relevant information direct to the Magento admin panel of the
            installation the module is part of. These notifications use the standard Magento admin messaging mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Messages are retrieved from the Absolute Commerce server via an external cURL request from the admin server
            of the installation the module is part of. To opt-out of retrieval of notifications entirely please install
            the latest version of all Absolute Commerce modules and disable the notification feature in the relevant
            section of each modules system configuration.
        </p>
        <p>When available the feed of notifications can be accessed directly here: https://absolutecommerce.co.uk/absolute/update
        </p>
        <p>For licencing purposes, the cURL requests to receive notifications are logged on the Absolute
            Commerce server.</p>
